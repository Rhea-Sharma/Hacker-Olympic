                <p>Moxies interior will make you like your living lavish. Having this will make the food 10x tastier
                    They provided an amazing selection of pasta and salads. Although they are on the more expensive side 
                    when it comes to the cost, the customer service and taste of food make the price worth it. I would rank this place
                a 4 out of 5!

                <p> In the Busy streets of Toronto, this place is the best place for cheap yet tasty food. Located on Queen St West with an amazing outdoor 
                    patio and in dine with a view to the busy streets. One issue with this I find is the waiting time. This is because since
                    the location of the restuarant is not that big they have limited seating which makes other customers wait outside for a long period
                    of time and on top of that after ordering the food, it takes a while to reach the table. Although with these downfalls
                    the price of the meals are very affordable and the taste is also very decent. Worth to check out! Would rank this place 
                    a 3 out of 5!
